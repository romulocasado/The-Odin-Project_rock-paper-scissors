 Rework of the first JS project from The Odin Project

 After sometime focusing on life's demands, it's time to return to my programming studies, I'm redoing from scratch a project I did months ago back when I was learning HTML, CSS and JS.

 I plan to re-familiarize myself with programming and finish the Odin Project Fundamentals course before the next steps.

 The NUMBER ONE OBJECTIVE is to write code in a human readable way (as clear as possible), and to preserve what's considered good practice.
