# The-Odin-Project_rock-paper-scissors

 Remaster of the first JS project from The Odin Project, a rock, paper, scissors game

 After sometime focusing on life's demands, it's time to return to my programming studies, I'm redoing from scratch a project I did months ago back when I was learning HTML, CSS and JS.

 I plan to re-familiarize myself with programming and finish the Odin Project Fundamentals course before the next steps.

 The nº 1 objective: write code in a human readable way (as clear as possible), and to preserve what's considered good practice.

 The nº 2 objective: remaster the first version of the game, which was played on console, to a version with UI and web responsiveness.

 The nº 3 objective: to commit in a standard, good practice, way. Even if I'm working alone on this project.
